DotBriefs
=========
DotBriefs [1]_ is a tool to facilitate keeping your dotfiles in Git, including
those with private information.

By keeping your configuration files in a public Git repository, you can share
your settings with others. Any private information is kept in a single file
store outside the repository. It's up to the user to transport this file.

This tool is similar in functionality to Briefcase [2]_ but differs
significantly. DotBriefs uses Git filtering to manage private information and
uses a different file hierarchy and naming convention.
